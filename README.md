Last, but not least, the result Screen who's have an ScroolView, that screen allows the use see your answer's, in green and the correct answer in red, also show you the answer index and if it's wrong or correct. Besides, the user can restart the Quiz again. 

So, that's a very simple flutter project but very interestring to work with some core concepts and stick around about the framework workflow and Widget's behaviours.
